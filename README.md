## Usage Notes
- Powershell Scripts are available to be ran directly. The binary *.exe files are compiled with ps2exe for convenience.
- If the program detects hyper-v is not running or installed, it will prompt to install hyper-v.  After enabling, it will prompt to restart the PC or not.
- PC needs to be restarted if hyper-v had to be enabled.
- Let the VM boot up and reboot a few times.  
- You may see drives being mounted and unmounted â€” this is normal.  
- The process:
  1. Creates the VHDX (VM disk)  
  2. Applies Windows images using **DISM**  
- **GPU Passthrough:** Do not enable Checkpoints, Dynamic Memory, or Enhanced Session Mode for proper GPU functionality.
- VM will inherit the Host PC's keyboard, language, locale and timezone settings
- Display Resolution on bootup uses QRes.exe Version 1.0.9.7 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/qres/)

# 2. Virtual Machine GPU Update
Right-click the program and select **Run As Administrator**.
## Parameters
- Click on the checkbox on the VM's for the GPU drivers to be updated
- Click on the checkbox "Start VM after update" to start the VMs selected after updating.
## Usage Notes
- Updating the GPU requires for the VMs to shutdown.  The program will shutdown the VMs automatically
- This program is separate from the Hyper-V VM Creator because this can be used independently after the drivers are updated on the Main Host PC
- This program is only tested/verified to work on VMs created by the Hyper-V VM Creator.

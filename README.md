## Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Notes / Recommendations |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **VM Name** | Name of the virtual machine | Also used as the hostname |
| **VM Location** | Folder where the VM and all files will be stored | Example: `C:\MyVMs`. A subdirectory with the VM Name is created automatically |
| **Intall ISO File** | Path to the Windows installation ISO | Supports **Windows 10 2004 or later** and **Windows 11** |
| **Win Edition** | Dropdown of detected Windows Editions | Select **PRO** for GPU passthrough support |
| **Local User** | User account created for the VM | Automatically logged in on first boot |
| **Local Password** | Password for the local user | Remember this! |

| **Virtual Switch** | Hyper-V virtual switch to use | Program detects existing switches; usually **Default Switch** |
| **Enable Checkpoints** | Enable VM checkpoints | Keep **unchecked** for GPU Passthrough |
| **Enable Dynamic Memory** | Allow dynamic memory allocation | Keep **unchecked** for GPU Passthrough |
| **Enable Enhanced Session Mode** | Enable enhanced session mode | Keep **unchecked** for GPU Passthrough |
| **Start VM after creation** | Launch VM immediately after creation | Recommended to check for convenience |
## Usage Notes
- If the program detects hyper-v is not running or installed, it will prompt to install hyper-v.  After enabling, it will prompt to restart the PC or not.
- PC needs to be restarted if hyper-v had to be enabled.
- Let the VM boot up and reboot a few times.  
- You may see drives being mounted and unmounted â€” this is normal.  
- The process:
  1. Creates the VHDX (VM disk)  
  2. Applies Windows images using **DISM**  
- **GPU Passthrough:** Do not enable Checkpoints, Dynamic Memory, or Enhanced Session Mode for proper GPU functionality.

# 2. Virtual Machine GPU Update
Right-click the program and select **Run As Administrator**.
## Parameters
- Click on the checkbox on the VM's for the GPU drivers to be updated
- Click on the checkbox "Start VM after update" to start the VMs selected after updating.
## Usage Notes
- Updating the GPU requires for the VMs to shutdown.  The program will shutdown the VMs automatically
- This program is separate from the Hyper-V VM Creator because this can be used independently after the drivers are updated on the Main Host PC
- This program is only tested/verified to work on VMs created by the Hyper-V VM Creator.
